File Metadata Microservice
==========================

This is the last project towards FCC's backend API projects. It's a file metadata microservice.

I have written the server code, which can save the uploaded file. But as that functionality is not needed towards this assignment I have commented out the call to server.

Find out working service [here](https://learned-house.glitch.me).
